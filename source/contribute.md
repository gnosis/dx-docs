The DutchX is **100% open source** and has been built as a community effort to improve
the problems that current centralized and decentralized platforms face.

The community is what makes the DutchX great.

Become part of it and contribute to create new interfaces, improve tools,
and spread the word.

Meet the community on Github and the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/gnosis/DutchX).
